    <b>About Me</b><br>
    I'm passionate about building meaningful software, solving real-world problems with data, <br>
    and making tech more accessible, supportive, and community-driven.  
    <br>I also serve on the ColorStack @ UConn E-Board as Social Media Chair—creating spaces where students feel seen and supported.

    <b>Education</b><br><br>

    <b>Crime Prediction in Connecticut | AI4ALL | Summer 2025 | (Still Improving)</b><br>
    • Engineered a dual-model crime intelligence system on a 497K+ record dataset using LightGBM, achieving 76.7% forecasting accuracy with a custom recursive time-series engine to prevent leakage in 30-day lookahead predictions.<br>
    • Developed a multi-class risk classifier (48.2% accuracy) and a Resource Analytics module to audit police staffing levels and gender demographics across 95+ municipalities.<br>
    • Deployed a Streamlit dashboard offering real-time forecasts, dynamic risk visualizations, and longitudinal officer trend analysis, demonstrating full MLOps workflow execution.<br><br>

    <b>F1 Chatbot | HackUMass & Independent Project | Fall 2024</b><br>
    • Built a real-time Formula 1 intelligence assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI GPT models, supporting natural-language queries over race results, telemetry, constructor histories, and season analytics.<br>
    • Designed a structured ingestion pipeline transforming 70+ years of FIA archives into vector embeddings, enhancing semantic recall for complex motorsport questions (pace deltas, pit strategy outcomes, driver comparisons).<br>
    • Implemented a hybrid reasoning system combining LLM inference with rules-based validation to prevent hallucinations in technical topics (tire degradation, ERS deployment, DRS impact).<br><br>

    <b>CodePath — Intermediate Web Development | Fall 2025</b><br>
    • Completed an intensive, project-driven engineering fellowship focused on React, Vite, Node, and Supabase.<br>
    • Built 10+ end-to-end apps (CryptoHustle, Crewmate Generator, Data Dashboard, etc.), strengthening component-driven architecture, RESTful integrations, and state management patterns.<br>
