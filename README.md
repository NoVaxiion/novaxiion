<h2 align="left">About Me</h2>
<p align="left">
  I am proudly Guatemalan and a first-generation college student, shaped by a background in skilled trades from Construction General Labor to CNC Cabinet Making. 
  I love cooking, baking, staying active in the gym, biking, and teaching myself automotive repair as I work on cars for maintenance. I’m dedicated to uplifting my community through advice, support, and being present for others.
</p>
<p align="left">
  I’m passionate about building meaningful software, solving real-world problems with data, and making technology more accessible, supportive, and community-centered. 
  I also serve on the ColorStack @ UConn E-Board as Social Media Chair, creating spaces where students feel seen, valued, and empowered. Hope you enjoy the stay! :)
